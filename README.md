## Introduction
- This project aims to predict the price of houses using ridge and lasso regression.
- The code is organized into separate files for data preprocessing, model building, model evaluation, finding the optimal lambda values, model selection, and model deployment.


## Technologies Used
- Python

 ## Model
 
 - We used ridge and lasso regression models with regularisation.

### Ridge Regression
 -  Ridge regression is a linear regression method that applies a penalisation to the model parameters. This penalisation helps to prevent overfitting.

### Lasso Regression
 - Lasso regression is another linear regression method that applies a penalisation to the model parameters. However, unlike ridge regression, lasso regression can result in some of the predictor variables being forced to zero, effectively performing feature selection.



## Conclusions
- This project successfully demonstrated the use of ridge and lasso regression for predicting the price of houses.
